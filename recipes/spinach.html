    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds baby spinach leaves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons good olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped garlic (6 cloves)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Lemon</li>
        <li>Sea or kosher salt, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the spinach well in cold water to make sure it's very clean. Spin it dry in a salad spinner, leaving
            just a little water clinging to the leaves.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In a very large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil and saute the garlic over medium heat for about 1
            minute, but not until it's browned. Add all the spinach, the salt, and pepper to the pot, toss it with the
            garlic and oil, cover the pot, and cook it for 2 minutes. Uncover the pot, turn the heat on high, and cook
            the spinach for another minute, stirring with a wooden spoon, until all the spinach is wilted. Using a
            slotted spoon, lift the spinach to a serving bowl and top with the butter, a squeeze of lemon, and a
            sprinkling of sea or kosher salt. Serve hot.</li>
